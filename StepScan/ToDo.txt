To Do list for step scanning:

  - save/loadd configuration of scan parameters.   This could use an INI
     file, or an SQLite database.  Prefer both.

  - Spec Mode should be able to save/load a motor/detector configuration file

  - Test Area Detectors -- so far I've only tested with Scalers and Multi-MCAs

  - XAFS Scan setup routine, with save/load

  - Allow limiting ROIs from MCA detector(s) by name, so that 'save all' is
    the default, but not the only option.

  - ASCII File writing works, but may need options (comment char, etc)

  - Should be an option for 'file per scan, with auto-increment' or
     'one long, spec-like file'.   How are mesh scans recorded with Spec?

  - Writing a proper Spec file?

  - Handling waveform data?   Writing to non-ASCII (HDF5?) files?

  - Data Viewing Program that can parse scan files (ASCII or HDF5)

  - Scan Setup / Execute GUI.  This should have form options for defining:
       -- simple 1d  scans (spec ascan)
       -- multi-positioner 1d scans
       -- XAFS scans
       -- 2-D mesh / map scans
       -- simple 'filename', 'comments', 'start', 'abort', 'pause',  'resume'.

       -- Use Sqlite db for saving configs (what positioners/detectors
            are available) and individual scan definitions.

       -- Macro window with do_scan(saved_definition)/ascan/etc.

       -- Plotting of live scan, pull-downs for what to plot
       -- Plotting simple peak analysis, derivative analysis,
            move to position , etc.

Need to choose GUI toolkit.
